## About Me

I'm a budding frontend developer, embarking on this journey with wide-eyed curiosity and a meticulous attention to detail. Before diving into code, I honed my creative skills through video editing, where I loved piecing together stories frame by frame — skills that now fuel my passion for crafting seamless user experiences on the web.

I thrive on staying ahead of the curve, constantly tracking emerging technologies to inspire my growth. At my core, I'm driven by a mindset that prizes not just acquiring knowledge, but nurturing patience, relentless curiosity, and a genuine hunger to evolve — editing my future, frame by frame.
